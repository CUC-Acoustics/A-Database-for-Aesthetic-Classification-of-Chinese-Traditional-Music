# A-Database-for-Aesthetic-Classification-of-Chinese-Traditional-Music
Through a series of experimental methods, the aesthetic classification with five categories of Chinese traditional music was obtained. Then the music database with aesthetic‐emotional multi‐annotation was established. The database was manually labelled according to the discrete aesthetic categories and the emotional VA dimension model. Through the statistics and analysis of the annotation information, it was found that the distribution of different aesthetic categories in the VA emotional space could be separated clearly. 
The quantification and identification of aesthetics for Chinese traditional music is just a preliminary attempt. The database also provides the data foundation for the research of cross‐cultural music perception. In the future, the database can be further expanded. What's more, multi‐label analysis can be used to explore the ambiguity characteristics of aesthetics and improve the recognition accuracy.
